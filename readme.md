# Phpx

Documentation can be found at [preprocess.io](https://preprocess.io#phpx).

## Motivation

I wanted to write a custom compiler, and this syntax appeals to me. It's not a replacement for client-side code, or even a very good implementation. But, I like it. That's all that counts.

If you want to write component-based code, without writing front-end code; then this might work for you. 

## Getting started

- Clone the repository
- Install the Compoer dependencies
- Run the tests _or_ execute the example scripts

This should work on PHP 7.2 (where it was developed and tested). Make an issue if it's not working on 7.2, for you.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Support HTML element warnings and rewriting
- [ ] Move HTML renderer to its own library
- [ ] Set up StyleCI and Travis
- [ ] Write more tests
- [ ] Experiment with other renderers
- [ ] Document like it's 1999
